cli.py workflow for retrieving experiment results:

Run the following script, this may take a while
```bash
./cli.py encode --conf videos.conf -o videos/
```

Run the following script, this may take a while as well
```bash
./cli face-recognition-test --conf face-tests.conf -o results/
```

Run the following script to extract the data from the output log generated by the previous command
```bash
./cli.py extract-logs -i results/face-recognitions.log -o recognition-test-data.csv
```

The following command is non-essential but it may help with analysing the bit rates by splitting them into separate folders
```bash
./cli.pi bin-results -i results/
```
