# R2D2 - Scrum-team-6 - Experiment GitHub

This repository was created to store any and all code necessary for the set of experiments we intend to carry out to supplement our Research Paper. The purpose of these experiments is to gather data surrounding the highest achievable bit rate, the practical range and the amount of energy expended by WiFi, ZigBee and BlueTooth modules. Furthermore, we will try to find the optimal distribution between a live video feed and a separate full-duplex data stream, allowing communication to and fro while also ensuring a stable, high-quality video feed to be used at the same time.
